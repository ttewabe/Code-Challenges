<p>Complete each challenge listed below by editing the code inside the JS section of this Codepen. Place your code in the areas indicated by the comments.</p>
<p>Use the developer console or the Codepen console (with the Console button provided by Codepen at the bottom left of your screen) to see console.log messages. Be aware that the Codepen console does not show all error messages, so if you're running into an error, try opening your browser's built-in developer console. </p>

<h3>Challenge 1</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use the <strong>map</strong> method on the numbers array given at line 2 to add 5 to each number and put the results into a new array. The code has been started for you at line 3. 
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Challenge 2</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Use the map method on the same numbers array to turn it into an array of strings, and add a colon and a space after each number. The code has been started for you at line 7. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Challenge 3</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Use the map method on the words array on line 13 to remove the "s" from the end of each word.
