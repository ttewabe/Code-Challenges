<input type="text" onkeyup="fixLength()" />

<hr />

<p>This Code Challenge is intended to give you more practice with event listeners, as well as introduce you to the concept of string methods and give you practice with researching and using built-in JavaScript methods.</p>
<p>You will need to update the code in the JS section of this Codepen to complete this challenge, as well as remove the onkeyup attribute from the input element in the HTML section.</p>

<h3>Code Challenge</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  You have been tasked to create an app called Microtwitter. A microtweet can be no more than 12 characters long.</li>
<li>In the JS section of this Codepen, convert the inline <strong><em>onkeyup</em></strong> onevent handler from the HTML section to an <strong>event listener</strong> in the JS.</li>
<li>Complete the the code inside the <strong>fixLength()</strong> function in the JS section so that <strong>if</strong> you type more than 12 characters inside the input field above, the final character is automatically removed. 
</li>
  <li>Like arrays, strings also have methods you can use with them, and you can check the length of a string using the <strong>.length</strong> property just as you can with arrays. You will need to use a string method for this. Look in the Resources section for clues.</li>
  <li>You will need to access the <strong>value</strong> of the input element, which is automatically set to whatever is typed into the text box. See the Resources section for more about the value. 
</ul>
