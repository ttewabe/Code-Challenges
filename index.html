<p>Read the JS section of this Codepen then click the Filter button and observe the effects.</p>
<p>Challenge 1: Add a new function named filterRatings. Add a corresponding second button in the HTML section. Write the code so that when that button is clicked, you get a list of only the restaurants with a rating 5 or higher. </p>
<p>Challenge 2: Add yet another filter option: Can you add a button that will filter for restaurants whose names begin with the letter "C" only?</p>
